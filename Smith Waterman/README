refineHits.c
compile:	gcc -pthread refineHits.c -o refine.out
run:		./refine.out <dna File> <reads File> <hits File> <difference> <results File>
this program takes a dna file, a reads file and a hits file in the format:
dna file - dna is a long string of characters in the same line
reads file - every read is in a different line (reads separated by '\n')
hits file - every read have the number of hits first of all and after that each of the offsets of the hits in each line
the program take those 3 files, the number of differences allowed and calculate the best hit for each read and print it in the result file
result file format is:
Read id: <ID>
<read string>
hit offset: <offset>
<part of the DNA>
<alignment data>
<read>
Score: <hit score>
