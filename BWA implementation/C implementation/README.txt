THE C IMPLEMENTATION

old implementation:
this implementation is not fully functional because we abandoned it in the middle of the work due to the fact that we understand the BWA algorithm and we wanted to move forward with the project and focus on the pairing part.
this implementation can print all of the data created along the way which is good for testing but it has a problem that we didn't found so we switched to java implementation.

new implementation:
the new implementation inst working even though the BWA algorithm code is the same as in the java implementation.
the group class code is a memory efficent that after failing to use with the c implementation we changed it to java language and used it there.
